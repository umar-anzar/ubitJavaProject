## Animations
<!--Description of animation-->
As we all know java swing is an old framework and there is no concept of built-in animation in it. So using multi threading concept, we created animations by overriding `run()` method, having a loop inside it and use of `thread.sleep()` to change opactiy gradually and at some places changing the size of **Jpanels** or moving them left and right to add animation in our ui.
